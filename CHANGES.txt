1.7.1 (July 25, 2022)
 - Updated some dependencies for vulnerability fixes.

1.7.0 (July 25, 2022)
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio dependency to version 10.21.1, which includes:
      - Added `autoRequire` configuration option to the Google Analytics to Split integration, which takes care of requiring the splitTracker plugin on trackers dynamically created by Google tag managers (See https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360040838752#set-up-with-gtm-and-gtag.js).
      - Updated browser listener to push remaining impressions and events on 'visibilitychange' and 'pagehide' DOM events, instead of 'unload', which is not reliable in modern mobile and desktop Web browsers.
      - Updated the synchronization flow to be more reliable in the event of an edge case generating delay in cache purge propagation, keeping the SDK cache properly synced.

1.6.0 (June 30, 2022)
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio dependency to version 10.20.0, which includes:
      - Added a new config option to control the tasks that listen or poll for updates on feature flags and segments, via the new config sync.enabled . Running online Split will always pull the most recent updates upon initialization, this only affects updates fetching on a running instance. Useful when a consistent session experience is a must or to save resources when updates are not being used.
      - Updated telemetry logic to track the anonymous config for user consent flag set to declined or unknown.
      - Updated submitters logic, to avoid duplicating the post of impressions to Split cloud when the SDK is destroyed while its periodic post of impressions is running.

1.5.0 (June 13, 2022)
 - Bugfixing - Fixed issue with useTreatments hooks, to return control treatments without evaluating splits when the SDK client is not ready or is destroyed, to avoid not ready impressions and warning log.
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio dependency to version 10.19.1, which includes:
      - Added `scheduler.telemetryRefreshRate` property to SDK configuration, and deprecated `scheduler.metricsRefreshRate` property.
      - Updated SDK telemetry storage, metrics and updater to be more effective and send less often.
      - Updated eventsource dependency range to ^1.1.2 to avoid a vulnerability and dependency resolution to a vulnerable version of url-parse transitive dependency.
      - Bugfixing - Updated submitters logic, to avoid dropping impressions and events that are being tracked while POST request is pending.

1.4.1 (May 11, 2022)
 - Updated React peer dependency range to include React@18.x.x.
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio dependency to version 10.18.2, which includes some vulnerability fixes.

1.4.0 (April 11, 2022)
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio dependency to version 10.18.0, which includes:
      - Added user consent feature to allow delaying or disabling the data tracking from SDK until user consent is explicitly granted or declined. Read more in our docs.
      - Added `scheduler.impressionsQueueSize` property to SDK configuration to limit the amount of impressions tracked in memory. Read more in our docs.
      - Added support to SDK clients on browser to optionally bind attributes to the client, keeping these loaded within the SDK along with the user ID, for easier usage when requesting flag.
      - Updated format for MySegments keys in LocalStorage, keeping backwards compatibility (issue https://github.com/splitio/javascript-client/issues/638).
      - Updated dependencies for vulnerability fixes, general polishing, and bug fixes.

1.3.0 (September 29, 2021)
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio dependency to version 10.16.0, which includes:
      - Updated localhost mode to emit SDK_READY_FROM_CACHE event in Browser when using localStorage (issue https://github.com/splitio/react-client/issues/34).
      - Updated streaming logic to use the newest version of our streaming service, including:
            - Integration with Auth service V2, connecting to the new channels and applying the received connection delay.
            - Implemented handling of the new MySegmentsV2 notification types (SegmentRemoval, KeyList, Bounded and Unbounded)
            - New control notification for environment scoped streaming reset.
 - Updated some development dependencies to their latest versions, including Webpack 4 to 5, to build a more optimized UMD bundle.

1.2.6 (June 3, 2021)
 - Updated internal event listeners to avoid some misleading error logs.
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio dependency to version 10.15.7, which fixes some issues with localhost mode (issue #13).
 - Updated some NPM dependencies mostly for vulnerability fixes.
 - Updated ES modules build to target ES5.

1.2.5 (April 29, 2021)
 - Updated some NPM dependencies mostly for vulnerability fixes.
 - Updated Split's SDK package for vulnerability fixes.

1.2.4 (February 11, 2021)
 - Updated CommonJS and ES Modules builds to always resolve browser modules of the Javascript SDK and avoid issues when using Node-based testing framework such as Jest (issues #13, #34).

1.2.3 (February 8, 2021)
 - Updated React peer dependency range to include React@17.x.x.
 - Added `memoize-one` dependency for basic memoization utilities.
 - Bugfixing - Optimizing splits evaluation via memoization in order to remove `shouldComponentUpdate` method of `SplitTreatments` component and avoid stopping render propagation (issue #42).

1.2.2 (December 15, 2020)
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio dependency to version 10.15.2.
 - Updated internal validation to avoid errors when passing an invalid list of split names to `SplitTreatments` component and `useTreatments` hook.
 - Updated node-fetch and init dev dependencies for vulnerability fixes

1.2.1 (Oct 7, 2020)
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio dependency to version 10.15.0, which uses the optimized impressions sending and supports filtering the splits to be synced. Learn more in our javascript-client changelog or documentation.
 - Updated some NPM dependencies mostly for vulnerability fixes.

1.2.0 (July 23, 2020)
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio dependency to version 10.13.0, which uses streaming synchronization by default, amongst other updates. Learn more in our javascript-client changelog or documentation.
 - Updated `shouldComponentUpdate` method of `SplitTreatments` component for optimization: it only updates if the treatment evaluation changes.
 - Updated build configuration to exclude React library from UMD bundle.
 - Added missing status properties of Split clients into SplitContext: `isReadyFromCache`, `hasTimedout`, and `isDestroyed`. They are passed down as props when using functions as a child of both SplitFactory, SplitClient and SplitTreatments components.
 - Added an optional prop to `SplitFactory` and `SplitClient`: `updateOnSdkReadyFromCache`, to update the component when an SDK_READY_FROM_CACHE event is emitted. Its value is true by default.
 - Added gracefull shutdown of the SDK, when SplitFactory component is unmounted.
 - Added validation and error logs associated to the use of incompatible React library versions.
 - Bugfixing - Incorrect status properties in SplitContext when using SplitClient component.
 - Bugfixing - Properly handling side-effects (creating Split factory) in SplitFactory component constructor.
 - Bugfixing - Properly handling component state updates in React commit phase.

1.1.0 (March 11, 2020)
 - Exported `SplitContext` to access Split readiness state when using React hooks.
 - Bugfixing - issue with SDK_READY_TIMED_OUT events.

1.0.0 (January 24, 2020)
